#MongoDB connection with express

## 1. first create the mongodb and the express environment 
## 2. connect the mongoose as it is key to the mongoDB for the data schema
## 3. establish the ports and the get statments
## 4. now create the views for the template using ejs as they are the key for template interface
## 5. now create a separate folder for the mongodb schema make sure create a model after schema cause model is key to inset the data in schema format
## 6. create an another init.js file cause this helps us to create database with multiple data
## 7. getting the data form the database to the interface is an async function that we can observe in the console to avoid that we use async await process
## 8. i just want to display all the chats in the interface so i choose to create a ejs template in the "/chats".
